LONG_DESCRIPTION = """\
Blitz is a document-oriented database toolkit for Python that is backend-agnostic.

It comes with a flat-file database for JSON documents and provides MongoDB-like querying capabilities.

Key Features
============

* Document-based, object-oriented interface.
* Powerful and rich querying language.
* Deep document indexes on arbitrary fields.
* Compressed storage of documents.
* Support for multiple backends (e.g. file-based storage, MongoDB).
* Support for database transactions (currently only for the file-based backend).

Documentation
=============

An extensive documentation, including tutorials and installation instructions, is available on `ReadTheDocs <http://blitz-db.readthedocs.org/>`_.

Source Code
===========

The source code is available on `GitHub <https://github.com/adewes/blitzdb>`_.

Issue Tracker
=============

If you encounter any problems when using BlitzDB, please feel free to `submit an issue <https://github.com/adewes/blitzdb/issues>`_ on GitHub.

Changelog
=========

* 0.4.4: SQL backend: Do not coerce server_default values via a CAST, as this can cause incompatibilities.
* 0.4.3: Many small improvements to the SQL backend.
* 0.3.3: Be more robust against corrupted data for foreign key objects. Fix problem with intersection of query sets in SQL backend.
* 0.3.2: Give the user more control over cascading deletes for foreign keys and M2M objects in the SQL backend.
* 0.3.1: Made intersect statement more efficient (and avoid using CTEs for that).
* 0.3.0: Fully functional SQL backend.
* 0.2.12: Added support for proper attribute iteration to `Document`.
* 0.2.11: Allow setting the `collection` parameter through a `Document.Meta` attribute.
* 0.2.10: Bugfix-Release: Fix Python 3 compatibility issue.
* 0.2.9: Bugfix-Release: Fix serialization problem with file backend.
* 0.2.8: Added `get`, `has_key`, and `clear` methods to `Document` class.
* 0.2.7: Fixed problem with `__unicode__` function in Python 3.
* 0.2.6: Bugfix-Release: Fixed an issue with the `$exists` operator for the file backend.
* 0.2.5: Bugfix-Release
* 0.2.4: Added support for projections and update operations to the MongoDB backend.
* 0.2.3: Bugfix-Release: Fixed bug in transaction data caching in MongoDB backend.
* 0.2.2: Fix for slice operators in MongoDB backend.
* 0.2.1: Better tests.
* 0.2.0: Support for including additional information in DB references. Support for accessing document attributes as dictionary items.
         Added `$regex` parameter that allows using regular expressions in queries.
* 0.1.5: MongoDB backend now supports database transactions. Database operations are now read-isolated by default, i.e.
         uncommitted operations will not affect database queries before they are committed.
* 0.1.4: Improved indexing of objects for the file backend, added support for automatic serialization/deserialization
         of object attributes when adding keys to or querying an index.
* 0.1.3: Sorting of query sets is now supported (still experimental).
* 0.1.2: Small bugfixes, BlitzDB version number now contained in DB config dict.
* 0.1.1: BlitzDB is now Python 3 compatible (thanks to David Koblas).
